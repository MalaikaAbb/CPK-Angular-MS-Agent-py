 *
 * Who this project is: which CopilotKit integration it tests, where its docs
 * live, and how its two services are reached and started.
 *
 * Everything else derives from this. Doc and demo URLs are built from
 * `docBaseUrl` and `frontendUrl`, so a page never repeats them and no page can
 * point at a different framework's docs by accident.
 *
 * `npm run doctor` rejects any field still set to REPLACE_ME, so a half-done
 * adaptation cannot pass as finished.

   * indistinguishable from the React one. Change this in the same commit as
   * `framework`, and delete clips left over under the old prefix — nothing
   * renames them, so they linger and read as current.

   * never replied. Measured here at 59s of compile inside a 74s request.
