/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  ADAPT THIS FILE — 3 of 3
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * One entry per doc page, in the order the doc nav lists them.
 *
 * Entries are deliberately short. `docUrl`, `demoUrl` and the output filename
 * are derived from `project.config.ts` plus the fields below, so no entry can
 * point at the wrong framework's docs and filenames stay in nav order without
 * anyone numbering them by hand.
 *
 * Adapting means: delete the pages this framework does not document, add the
 * ones it does, and fix the line ranges. `npm run doctor` then tells you which
 * ranges no longer point at real code.
 *
 * ── Scope, for this repo ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `route` + `demoSuffix` is the only demo URL a page can have, and the doctor
 * errors on any that is not 200. This app's nav lists 12 doc routes; the
 * Introduction landing page (`/`) is the one without a `/demo` of its own —
 * `demoPath()` in nav-config.ts returns undefined for it — so it is deliberately
 * absent below rather than registered and broken. `/status` is app furniture
 * rather than a doc page, and is likewise absent.
 *
 * Everything here mirrors `frontend/src/app/lib/nav-config.ts`, the app's single
 * source of truth for route -> doc-page mapping. `docPath` is that file's
 * `docPath` minus its leading `/angular/ms-agent-python`. Four routes (threads,
 * memory, attachments, headless) repeat one `docPath` because the Angular docs
 * cover all four topics on a single page — that is the doc's shape, not a
 * copy/paste slip.
 *
 * ── The line ranges ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `startLine`/`endLine` are what the simulated IDE highlights. They are
 * hardcoded, so they drift the moment someone edits a demo component. Doctor
 * guards ranges in files carrying `[!code highlight]` or `#region` markers.
 * This frontend uses neither: it brackets each documented snippet with
 * `// <topic> : <snippet name> start|end` line comments, which
 * frontend/scripts/generate-sources.ts reads. Every range below was set from
 * those brackets by hand, so `npm run doctor` proves a range is in-bounds, not
 * that it still frames the snippet the page is about — re-read them after
 * editing a feature component. Teaching the doctor this repo's marker syntax
 * would restore the guard, but that is a `core/` change and therefore a finding
 * to report, not something to do here.
 */

import { type PageDefinition, definePages } from '../core/types';

const RESERVED_PREFIX = 'reserved:';

/**
 * A slot in the Angular guide list that this repo has no demo for.
 *
 * The clip index is `definePages`' array position, so without these the
 * numbering closes up over a missing page: Shared State recorded as `06` here
 * and `07` in Agno-angular and Mastra-angular, which document the same guides
 * in the same order. The clips land in one folder, so two files with the same
 * number showing different guides is exactly the confusion the numbering is
 * there to prevent.
 *
 * Reserving the slot keeps the number attached to the guide rather than to
 * whatever this repo happens to record. A reserved entry exists only to occupy
 * an index — it is filtered out below, before `definePages`' result is
 * exported, so no doctor check, CLI flag, shard split or recording ever sees
 * one. Its fields are placeholders for that reason.
 *
 * When the demo does land, replace the `reserve(...)` call with the real entry
 * in place and the number it has always been reserved for is the one it gets.
