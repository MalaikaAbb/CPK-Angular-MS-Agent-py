 * What the recorder *does* on each demo page once it is open.
 *
 * The registry lives here rather than in `core/` on purpose: adding or removing
 * a page must never mean editing frozen code. A page with no entry falls back
 * to `runStandardAction` — type the prompt, submit, wait for the reply — which
 * is right for most pages. Write a handler only when a page needs more than
 * that: switching tabs, clicking an approval button, opening a panel.
 *
 * Handlers should build on the helpers in `core/actions.ts`:
 *
 *   sendPrompt(page, prompt, opts)          types and submits, returns the
 *                                           assistant-message count from before
 *                                           submitting
 *   waitForAgentResponseCompletion(...)     waits for the reply to finish, and
 *                                           throws if none ever arrives
 *   promptsFor(config)                      the page's prompts[] , or [prompt]
 *
 * Pass that returned count into waitForAgentResponseCompletion on multi-turn
 * pages, or the previous turn's reply is mistaken for this one's.
 *
 * The fourth argument, `ctx`, is how a handler reports what it saw:
 *
 *   ctx.warn('"Mark high priority" button not found')  -> [PASS*] with the note
 *   ctx.fail('approval card never rendered')           -> [FAIL], clip still saved
 *
 * A `console.warn` reaches nobody: the summary, videos/RECORD_RESULTS.json and
 * the CI report only see what goes through `ctx`.
