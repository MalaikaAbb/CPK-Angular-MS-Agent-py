/**
 * A2UI — enabled on the runtime, inert in the browser, and the recording says so.
 *
 * https://docs.copilotkit.ai/angular/ms-agent-python/guides/a2ui
 *
 * `a2ui: {}` in frontend/server.ts turns the middleware on and `/info` duly
 * reports `a2uiEnabled: true`, but supplying `a2ui.catalog` is what actually
 * registers the `render_a2ui` renderer — and the guide's catalog snippet is not
 * self-contained (it references `dynamicString`, `beautifulCatalog`,
 * `declarativeCatalog`, `fixedCatalog` and `productCatalog`, none of which the
 * guide defines). So the agent answers in prose and no declarative UI appears.
 *
 * The prompt is still sent: "asked for a card, got a paragraph" is the finding,
 * and it is only demonstrable by asking. The Notepad note then records what is
 * missing, while the prose answer is still on screen behind it.
 *
 * Before any of that, the take stops on the harness's own /a2ui notes route,
 * marks the reconstructed `a2uiConfigForFeature` block and writes down that the
 * guide never declares the catalogs it returns, so that code was written here.
 * See actions/catalog-code.ts.
 *
 * The legacy recorder made this a doc-only page and highlighted the missing
 * identifiers in the guide itself. This engine always drives the demo route, so
 * the finding moved onto the demo page — the substance is the same, and the doc
 * scroll at the head of the video still shows the snippets in question.
