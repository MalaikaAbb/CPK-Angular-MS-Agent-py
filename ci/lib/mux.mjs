/**
 * Voiceover muxing — the only implementation.
 *
 * In the React repos this existed twice: once here (run per shard) and again in
 * the workflow's consolidate job, so a shard's audio got muxed and consolidate
 * muxed the same track onto the already-muxed file. Muxing happens once, where
 * the video is produced; the workflow just installs ffmpeg and lets this run.
 *
 * Four pages carry a voiceover: Frontend Tools & Generative UI, Voice &
 * multimodal, Shared State and Threads. The tracks live in
 * `autorecorder/audio/` and are shared verbatim by the Angular repos — the
 * narration is about the CopilotKit concept, not the agent framework behind it,
 * and all of them now run the same handler for these pages, so one recording
 * fits AG2-, AGNO-, DAPY-, MASTRA- and MSPY-angular. Every other clip stays
 * silent and is skipped by the table below.
 *
 * WebM carries only Vorbis or Opus, and the choice is not free: Windows Media
 * Player renders VP8 fine and has no Opus decoder, so an Opus track plays as
 * silence there with no error and no warning — which is how a correctly muxed
 * clip gets reported as "the video has no audio". Vorbis is decoded by WMP and
 * by every browser, so it is what these are encoded with. Missing ffmpeg is a
 * skip, not a failure: a silent demo still beats no demo.
